Hey! I'm Xan. I solve messy data problems and turn them into clear business solutions. Right now I'm neck-deep in analytics and data engineering, but I'm increasingly diving into data science because I love finding hidden patterns in data and shaping the future.

Most days you'll find me writing Python and SQL, building data pipelines, or creating visualizations that actually make sense to people. I've gotten pretty good with tools like Domo and Mode, and I've built some cool projects â€“ from advanced dataflows to a CI/CD pipeline that saved our team countless hours of manual work. These days I'm geeking out over machine learning and stats, finding ways to apply them to real problems.

I really enjoy teaching others about data. Whether I'm helping junior team mates learn the ropes or working with different teams to solve problems nad improve provcesses, I believe the best solutions come from collaboration. There's always something new to learn in this field, and that's what keeps me excited about it.

Outside of work, I'm usually strength traininng or running (preparing for my first half marathon!) or hanging out with my Golden Doodle, Scarlett, who's convinced every Amazon delivery is full of treats just for her.
