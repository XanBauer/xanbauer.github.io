Howdy! I'm Xan. For the past five years, I have been working as a data analyst/engineer. Iâ€™m on the front lines, diving into complex data challenges and emerging with scalable solutions producing actionably insights. I am transitioning to data science where I find joy in uncovering interesting patterns and get to employ my love for statistics.

On any given day, I am coding in Python or SQL and working with BI tools like Domo and Mode. In my current role, I've architected data pipelines that transformed a chaotic mix of 50+ data sources into business ready datasets for internal and external stakeholders. With that data, I have created various dashboards specializing in efficient and scalable designs.  One of my favorite accomplishments is learning how to build and implement a CI/CD pipeline which has protected business critical processes from pesky bugs and edge cases. I am seeking more opportunities to use data science and multiply my impact. Check out my projects to see some examples of my work! 

When I'm not wrangling data, you can find me strength training or running around town lake (currently preparing for my first half marathon!) or playing with by my Golden Doodle pup, Scarlettwho's convinced every amazon delivery is full of treats just for her.
